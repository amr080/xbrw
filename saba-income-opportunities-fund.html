         <p>Inception Date - Class A: May 12, 1988</p>
         <p><b>The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current
               performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and
               principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may
               be worth more or less than their original cost. See above "Performance" for performance information
               current to the most recent month-end.</b></p>
         <p><b>The returns are presented net of fees, which includes the deduction of expenses (including brokerage
               commissions, administrative expenses, management fees and accrued performance allocations, if any) and
               the reinvestment of all dividends, interest, and capital gains, if any.</b></p>
         <p>Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the
            beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of
            dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance
            with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund
            expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not
            annualized for periods less than one year.</p>
         <p><sup>1</sup>Shares are bought and sold at market price not net asset value (NAV) and are not individually
            redeemed from the Fund. Market performance is determined using the bid/ask midpoint at 4:00 p.m. Eastern
            time when the NAV is typically calculated. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.</p>
         <p><sup>2</sup>The Current Distribution Amount represents the amount approved by the Board of the Fund as part
            of a managed distribution plan. As part of the managed distribution plan, the Fund will make monthly
            distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of <span class="distributionFootnote-BRW"></span> per share.
            Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan), including the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in January 2024. The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s plan and the requirements
            prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan is intended to
            provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and
            is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common
            shares, but there is no assurance that the plan will be successful in doing so.</p>
         <p>Yield figures quoted should not be used as an indication of the income that has or will be received. Yield
            figures are based on the portfolio's underlying holdings and do not represent a payout of the portfolio.</p>
         <p><sup>3</sup>Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, the Voya Prime Rate Trust, previously
            managed by Voya Financial, became the Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund and Saba Capital Management,
            L.P. became the fund’s new investment adviser. The Fund’s name, investment adviser, and investment program
            have changed.</p>
         <p>Shareholders of the Fund approved the following changes to the Fund’s investment program at a special
            shareholder meeting on May 21, 2021:</p>
         <ul class="list-disc">
            <li>To approve the New Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and Saba Capital Management, L.P.
            </li>
            <li>To remove the Fund’s fundamental investment restriction relating to investing in warrants</li>
            <li>To remove the Fund’s fundamental investment restriction relating to purchasing or selling equity
               securities, engaging in short-selling and the use of certain option arrangements</li>
            <li>To remove the Fund’s fundamental investment restriction relating to investing in other investment
               companies</li>
            <li>To approve changing the Fund’s sub-classification under the Investment Company Act of 1940 from
               “diversified” to “non-diversified”</li>
            <li>To approve a change of the Fund’s investment objective and to make the investment objective
               non-fundamental</li>
         </ul>
         <p id="aumFootnote"></p>
         <p><sup>5</sup>Effective after the close of business on June 4, 2021, Saba Capital Management, LP became the
            manager of the Fund. Performance of the Fund prior to the close of business on June 4, 2021 is not
            attributable to Saba Capital Management, LP.</p>
         <p><sup>6</sup>Expense Ratios are as of <span data-action="expense" data-location="thisFundArray[0]"
               data-key="asofdate"></span>. Saba Capital Management has contractually agreed to limit expenses of the
            Fund. This expense limitation agreement excludes interest, taxes, investor relations services, other
            investment-related costs, leverage expenses, and extraordinary expenses such as litigation, other expenses
            not incurred in the ordinary course of business, and expenses of any counsel or other persons or services
            retained by the Fund’s Trustees. The expense agreement shall automatically renew for one-year terms unless
            otherwise terminated in accordance with the provisions outlined in the agreement. The current term of the
            expense agreement expires on July 1, 2024. The Expense Ratios include expense waivers to average net assets
            and the Gross Expense Ratio includes interest expense and other fees related to the revolving credit
            facility to average net assets. The Expense Ratio does not include acquired fund fees and expenses.</p>
         <p><sup>7</sup>Represents the performance since Saba Capital became the Fund’s investment advisor on June 4,
            2021</p>
         <p><sup>8</sup>Assumes reinvestment of distributions based on the dividend reinvestment and cash purchase plan.
         </p>
         <p><sup>9</sup>The market price is determined using the last trade on the listing exchange at the time that the
            fund's NAV is calculated.</p>
         <p><sup>10</sup>The Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2023 through <span class="asofdateASNNAV--BRW"></span> (which includes the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in January 2024) annualized as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of <span class="asofdateASNNAV--BRW"></span>. The distribution rate shown is not constant as the Fund’s NAV fluctuates regularly. In addition, the level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may not be paid in the future.  Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown. A portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital which should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” Please see the Fund’s most-recent Section 19a Notice press release found in the “Section 19a Notice” section of this website. <strong>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results.</strong></p>

<div class="disclosure">
	<p>** Please note amounts shown above for dividends with a payable date prior to 5/20/2022 have been adjusted to reflect the 2 to 1 reverse stock split which occurred on 5/20/2022.</p>
	<p>The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital, which will have the effect of reducing your cost basis in the Fund’s shares and thereby increasing the amount of capital gain, if any, or decreasing the amount of capital loss, if any, that you will realize when selling or exchanging Fund shares. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The final determination of the tax characteristics cannot be determined until after year end and reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV at that time.</p>
	<p>To obtain an estimate of the components for each distribution please refer to the distribution press releases.  </p>
	<p>The tax treatment and characterization of the Fund’s distributions may vary significantly from time to time, depending on whether the Fund has gains or losses on the call options written on its portfolio versus gains or losses on the equity securities in the portfolio. The Fund’s distributions will normally reflect past and projected net investment income, and may include income from dividends and interest, capital gains and/or a return of capital. The final composition of the tax characteristics of the distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the year, and will be reported to shareholders at that time. The amount of quarterly distributions will vary, depending on a number of factors. As portfolio and market conditions change, the rate of distributions on the common shares will change. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to declare a distribution in each period.</p>
	<p><strong>Shareholder Reinvestment Program</strong></p>
	<p>The Fund maintains a Shareholder Reinvestment Program (the “Program”) that allows participating shareholders to reinvest all dividends ("Dividends") in additional Common Shares of the Fund.  Pursuant to the Program, ALPS Fund Services, Inc. (“ALPS”), the Program administrator, purchases, from time to time, Common Shares on the open market to satisfy Dividend reinvestments. Such Common Shares are purchased on the open market only when the closing sale or bid price plus commission is less than the NAV per share of the Fund’s Common Shares on the valuation date. If the market price plus commissions is equal to or exceeds NAV, new Common Shares are issued by the Fund at the greater of (i) NAV or (ii) the market price of the Common Shares during the pricing period, minus a discount of 5%.  Common Shares issued by the Fund under the Program will be issued without a fee or a commission.</p>
	<p>Shareholders may elect to participate in the Program by submitting a completed participation form to ALPS, the Program administrator. The Program administrator will credit to each participant's account funds it receives from Dividends paid on Common Shares of the Fund registered in the participant's name. Shareholders may elect to close their account at any time by giving the Transfer Agent written notice. When a participant closes their account, the participant, upon request, will receive a certificate for full Common Shares in the account. Fractional Common Shares will be held and aggregated with other fractional Common Shares being liquidated by the Transfer Agent as agent of the Program and paid for by check when actually sold.</p>
	<p>Participants will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions with respect to the Program Administrator's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of Dividends.</p>
	<p>The automatic reinvestment of Dividends does not affect the tax characterization of the Dividends (i.e., capital gain distributions and income distributions are realized and subject to tax even though cash is not received). A shareholder whose Dividends are reinvested in Common Shares under the Program will be treated as having received a Dividend equal to either (i) if Common Shares are issued under the Program directly by the Trust, generally the fair market value of the Common Shares issued to the shareholder or (ii) if reinvestment is made through open market purchases, the amount of cash allocated to the shareholder for the purchase of Common Shares on its behalf in the open market.</p>
	<p>Additional information about the Program may be obtained by contacting the Program Administrator at +1 844-460-9411.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc">

            </ul>

            <p>On May 20, 2022, the Fund completed a reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of its common shares at a ratio of 1-for-2. In connection with the Reverse Split, every two shares of the Fund’s issued and outstanding common shares were converted into one single common share. Any less than whole shares that would be held by a shareholder after effecting the Reverse Split were then issued in fractional form. The Fund’s common shares continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BRW” and have a new CUSIP (78518H202). The Reverse Split reduced the number of the Fund’s authorized common shares from 85,058,986 shares to 42,529,493 shares.</p>

            <p class="margin-top-30"><strong>Important Risk Information</strong></p>

            <p>Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. </p>

            <p><b>The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed.</b> Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions.</p>

            <p>Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative or a guarantee of future results.</p>

            <p>All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. The fund invests primarily in credit instruments that carry a risk that borrowers may default in the timely payment of principal and interest on their debt, which would likely cause the value of the Fund’s Common Shares to decrease. Changes in short-term market interest rates will directly affect the yield on the Fund’s Common Shares. If such rates fall, the Fund’s yield will also fall. If interest rate spreads on the Fund’s credit investments decline in general, the yield on the Fund’s credit investments will fall and the value of the Fund’s credit investments may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on credit investments in the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for a portion of the Fund’s investments, the Fund’s ability to sell some assets in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for credit investments may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new credit investments acquired by the Fund, and it may also increase the price of credit investments purchased by the Fund in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for credit investments may adversely affect the price of such investments in the Fund’s portfolio, which would cause the Fund’s NAV to decrease. The Fund’s use of leverage through borrowings can adversely affect the yield on the Fund’s Common Shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Fund may engage in currency exchange transactions that seeks to hedge some or all of the economic impact to the Fund arising from foreign currency fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions, amplifying risks. A liquid market may not exist for derivatives held by the Fund. High-yield bonds have a higher risk of default or other adverse credit events, but have the potential to pay higher earnings over investment grade bonds. The higher risk of default, or the inability of the creditor to repay its debt, is the primary reason for the higher interest rates on high-yield bonds. The Fund intends to be non-diversified and may be subject to concentration risk and outsized market risk within the industries that it invests.</p>

            <p><sup>5</sup>Effective after the close of business on December 31, 2023, the Templeton Global Income Fund, previously managed by Franklin Templeton Advisers, Inc., became the Saba Capital Income & Opportunities Fund II (“Saba”) and Saba Capital Management, L.P. became the fund’s new investment adviser. The Fund’s name, investment adviser, and investment program changed.</p>

            <p>Shareholders of the Fund approved the following changes to the Fund’s investment program at a special shareholder meeting on October 25, 2023:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li>To approve the New Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and Saba Capital Management, L.P.</li>
                <li>To approve making the Fund’s investment objective "non-fundamental" to provide the Fund with greater investment flexibility.</li>
                <li>The removal of the Fund’s fundamental policy mandating that at least 65% of the Fund’s total assets be invested in at least three countries and in various types of debt instruments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><sup>6</sup>The Current Distribution Amount represents the amount approved by the Board of the Fund as part of a managed distribution plan. As part of the managed distribution plan, the Fund will make monthly distributions to shareholders at a fixed amount of <span class="distributionFootnote-SABA">-</span> per share. Thus, the distribution amount shown excludes special dividends (which are not paid pursuant to the plan), including the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in December 2023. The Fund will generally distribute amounts necessary to satisfy the Fund’s plan and the requirements prescribed by excise tax rules and Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan is intended to provide shareholders with a constant, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution each month and is intended to narrow the discount between the market price and the net asset value of the Fund’s common shares, but there is no assurance that the plan will be successful in doing so.</p>

            <p>Yield figures quoted should not be used as an indication of the income that has or will be received. Yield figures are based on the portfolio's underlying holdings and do not represent a payout of the portfolio.</p>

            <p><sup>7</sup>The Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the dollar value of distributions for the current fiscal period November 1, 2023 through <span class="asofdateASNNAV--SABA"></span> (which includes the special dividend paid during the current fiscal period in December 2023) annualized as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of <span class="asofdateASNNAV--SABA"></span>. The distribution rate shown is not constant as the Fund’s NAV fluctuates regularly. In addition, the level of distribution amount shown is not guaranteed and special dividends may not be paid in the future.  Further, no conclusions should be drawn about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount or rate of distribution shown. A portion of the Fund’s distribution to shareholders may be a return of capital which should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” Please see the Fund’s most-recent Section 19a Notice press release found in the “Section 19a Notice” section of this website. <strong>Past Performance is No Assurance of Future Results.</strong></p>

            <p class="margin-top-30"><strong>Important Risk Information</strong></p>

            <p>Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. </p>

            <p><b>The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed.</b> Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions.</p>

            <p>Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative or a guarantee of future results.</p>

            <p>All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. Each fund invests primarily in credit instruments that carry a risk that borrowers may default in the timely payment of principal and interest on their debt, which would likely cause the value of the Funds’ Common Shares to decrease. Changes in short-term market interest rates will directly affect the yield on the Funds’ Common Shares. If such rates fall, the Funds’ yield will also fall. If interest rate spreads on the Funds’ credit investments decline in general, the yield on the Funds’ credit investments will fall and the value of the Funds’ credit investments may decrease. When short-term market interest rates rise, because of the lag between changes in such short term rates and the resetting of the floating rates on credit investments in the Funds’ portfolio, the impact of rising rates will be delayed to the extent of such lag. Because of the limited secondary market for a portion of the Funds’ investments, the Funds’ ability to sell some assets in a timely fashion and/or at a favorable price may be limited. An increase in the demand for credit investments may adversely affect the rate of interest payable on new credit investments acquired by the Funds, and it may also increase the price of credit investments purchased by the Funds in the secondary market. A decrease in the demand for credit investments may adversely affect the price of such investments in the Funds’ portfolio, which would cause the Funds’ NAV to decrease. The Funds’ use of leverage through borrowings, if any, can adversely affect the yield on the Funds’ Common Shares. Investment in foreign borrowers involves special risks, including potentially less rigorous accounting requirements, differing legal systems and potential political, social and economic adversity. The Funds may engage in currency exchange transactions that seeks to hedge some or all of the economic impact to the Funds arising from foreign currency fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Investments in foreign securities may involve risks such as social and political instability, market illiquidity, exchange-rate fluctuations, a high level of volatility and limited regulation. Leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the Funds’ portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the NAV of the Funds generally to decline faster than it would otherwise. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions, amplifying risks. A liquid market may not exist for derivatives held by the Funds. High-yield bonds have a higher risk of default or other adverse credit events, but have the potential to pay higher earnings over investment grade bonds. The higher risk of default, or the inability of the creditor to repay its debt, is the primary reason for the higher interest rates on high-yield bonds. The Funds intend to be non-diversified and may be subject to concentration risk and outsized market risk within the industries that it invests.</p>
